Getting to know Django
----------------------

So I think I have found something to study in this computer world. I came to the conclusion that Django would be a very useful addition to the set of tools that I know, and I am getting to know it.

So, following the excellent Django docs, I did the following:

Make a new virtualenv, activate it, install django with pip, install mysqld on my debian box and configure the root password.
